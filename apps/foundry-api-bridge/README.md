# foundry-api-bridge

Foundry VTT module that exposes a WebSocket command interface to a self-hosted MCP server. Paired with [foundry-mcp](https://github.com/AlexDickerson/foundry-mcp) for Claude / MCP-client control of a live Foundry world.

Forked from [Alex Ivenkov's foundry-api-bridge](https://github.com/alexivenkov/foundry-api-bridge-module) v7.7.0 (MIT). The fork removes all upstream SaaS connectivity (Patreon auth flow, auto-update manifest, external WebSocket default) and adds a `create-scene` command handler. All modifications are documented in [PATCHES.md](PATCHES.md). The original license and copyright are preserved in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Architecture

```
MCP client ──HTTP──> foundry-mcp server ──WebSocket──> foundry-api-bridge (in GM browser)
                         (host:8765)                        (Foundry VTT v13+)
```

The module runs in the GM's browser tab, maintains a WebSocket to the MCP server, and executes commands against the Foundry API.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Watch mode (vite build --watch)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test         # Jest
```

## Docker (Foundry + module, all-in-one image)

Layers the module onto `felddy/foundryvtt:14`, so the container serves Foundry with the bridge module pre-installed. The MCP server runs separately — point its `FOUNDRY_WS_URL` at this container's websocket once the module is enabled in your world.

```bash
cp .env.example .env         # fill in FOUNDRY_USERNAME/PASSWORD
./local.sh up                # build image, deps, dist, start container
# open http://localhost:30000 and set up a world

./local.sh rebuild           # rebuild dist + restart container (seconds)
./local.sh logs              # tail container logs
./local.sh status            # container status
./local.sh stop              # keep data
./local.sh nuke              # destroy the data volume (asks first)
```

Data lives in a named Docker volume (`foundry-data-local`) by default, so the workflow is OS-portable. Set `FOUNDRY_DATA=/some/host/path` in `.env` to bind to a host path instead. Port defaults to 30000 and can be overridden via `FOUNDRY_PORT` if you already have a production container running on the same machine.

## Installation in Foundry

1. Enable the module in **Game Settings → Configure Settings → Module Management**.
2. Configure the WebSocket URL under **Game Settings → Configure Settings → Module Settings → Foundry API Bridge**:
   - Self-hosted MCP server: `ws://<server-host>:8765/foundry`
3. Reload the world. The module header bar shows connection state.

## Compatibility

| Foundry VTT Version | Status |
|---------------------|--------|
| v14                 | Verified (Docker base image) |
| v13                 | Verified |
| v12                 | Works |
